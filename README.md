## About Me

Hello there! I'm Rabiyabasari, and I'm passionate about the fascinating world of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design.

## Background

I am a third year student currently persuing Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 
My academic journey has given me a solid foundation in digital and analog circuit design and hardware description languages.
I hold a keen interest in VLSI design.

## Interests

- VLSI design and digital circuitry
- Schematic design and Layout design
- RTL Coding
- Static timing analysis
- ASIC design and verification
- Low-power and high-performance integrated circuits

## Projects

-Designed and implemented single cycle RISC-V processor.
Designed based on RISC-V instruction set| Implemented different modules in Verilog| Built top-level module and testbench 
for the same| Simulated and verified the design using Modelsim-Altera

-Designed and implemented five stage pipelined RISC-V processor.
Implemented modules for each stage in Verilog| Checking pipeline hazards and implemented hazard unit| Built Top-level Pipeline module and test bench for the same| 
Simulated and verified the design using Modelsim-Altera

-Standard Cell Design and Analysis from Schematic to GDS-II.
Designed and verified various basic gates for low-power and high-speed applications| using the Cadence Virtuoso tool suite in
a 180nm process technology| Developed schematic design and analyzed the transient and DC characteristics| Layout
design with LVS and DRC check

-Tomato Sorting System| Utilized computer vision techniques to process sensor data and accurately classify tomatoes based on their 
color, achieving a sorting accuracy of over 95%


## Skills

-Languages: Verilog, C, Python
-Software  : Cadence Virtuoso, Quartus Prime II, Modelsim-Altera, LabView, PICSimLab, Arduino IDE, Keil, Matlab
-Familiar with RTL Coding, Static timing analysis (STA), Schematic and Layout design
